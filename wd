wd (warp directory) lets you jump to custom directories in zsh, without using
cd. Why? Because cd seems inefficient when the folder is frequently visited or
has a long path. -- https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd

# Usage

## Add wrap point to current working directory:
> wd add foo
> wd add foo --force

## From any directory, wrap to foo with:
> wd foo

## foo with autocompletion
> wd foo some/inter/path

## Others
> wd list
> wd rm foo
> wd ls foo
> wl path foo
> wd show
> wd help
